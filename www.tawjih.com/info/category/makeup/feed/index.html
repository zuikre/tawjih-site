<p>Draping a saree can seem intimidating at first, but with a little practice, you can easily learn how to drape it at home. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to help you:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start with the right attire: Wear a fitted blouse or a crop top and a petticoat (underskirt) that matches the color of your saree.</li>



<li>Tuck in the petticoat: Put on the petticoat and make sure it fits comfortably around your waist. Fasten it tightly using a drawstring or elastic.</li>



<li>Begin with pleats: Take the plain end of the saree (non-pallu end) and tuck it into the petticoat slightly to the right of your navel. Make sure the length is such that the saree barely touches the floor.</li>



<li>Make the pleats: Hold the saree and make 5 to 7 pleats, around 5 inches wide each. Ensure the pleats are even and neatly aligned. Once done, tuck the pleats into the petticoat slightly to the left of the navel. Adjust the length as needed.</li>



<li>Arrange the pallu: Take the remaining length of the saree (the pallu) and drape it over your left shoulder. The end of the pallu should be at the back, slightly below knee level.</li>



<li>Secure the pallu: Use a safety pin to secure the pallu to your blouse on the left shoulder. This will prevent it from slipping.</li>



<li>Finishing touches: Adjust the pleats and make sure they are even and neatly arranged. Smooth out any creases or wrinkles. You can also use more safety pins to secure the pleats in place.</li>



<li>Complete the look: Now, accessorize your saree with appropriate jewelry, such as earrings, bangles, and a necklace. Additionally, you can wear high heels to maintain the proper length of the saree.</li>
</ol>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Remember, practice makes perfect. It might take a few tries to get the draping right, so be patient and keep trying. You can also watch video tutorials or seek assistance from someone experienced in saree draping.</p>

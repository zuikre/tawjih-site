<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Sign In to Your Google Account</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Open your web browser</strong> and go to <a href="https://forms.google.com">Google Forms</a>.</li>



<li>If youâ€™re not already signed in, youâ€™ll need to log in with your Google account credentials.</li>
</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Start a New Form</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Once signed in, youâ€™ll see a blank form template.</li>



<li>To create a new form, click the <strong>blank form</strong> button or choose from one of the pre-built templates available (e.g., &#8220;Event Registration,&#8221; &#8220;Survey,&#8221; etc.).</li>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Click on the &#8220;Theme&#8221; icon</strong> at the top of the page (it looks like a painter&#8217;s palette).</li>



<li>You can select from default theme colors, fonts, or upload your own images for a header. This can help make your form look more personalized or professional.</li>
</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 8: Share Your Form</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>When youâ€™re ready to distribute your form, click the <strong>Send</strong> button at the top right of the form editor.</li>



<li>You have several options to share your form:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Email</strong>: Enter the email addresses of people you want to send the form to.</li>



<li><strong>Link</strong>: Copy and share the link directly with people (you can shorten the link if needed).</li>



<li><strong>Embed HTML</strong>: Embed the form directly into your website by copying the HTML code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 10: Review and Close the Form</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you no longer want to accept responses, you can disable the form by toggling the <strong>Accepting Responses</strong> button to &#8220;off.&#8221;</li>



<li>You can also set up email notifications to alert you whenever a new response is submitted.</li>
</ol>

<p>Google Chromebook vs. Google Notebook</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Google Chromebook vs. Google Notebook: A Comparison</h2>



<p>In todayâ€™s world, technology has changed the way we work, study, and entertain ourselves. Among the wide array of devices available, <strong>Google Chromebooks</strong> and <strong>Google Notebooks</strong> are two prominent options that many users encounter. But are they the same, or do they serve different needs? In this article, we will explore the differences and similarities between these two devices, helping you choose the one best suited to your needs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Google Chromebook?</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="566" src="https://www.tawjih.com/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-chromebook-vs-google-notebook.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132" srcset="https://www.tawjih.com/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-chromebook-vs-google-notebook.jpg 800w, https://www.tawjih.com/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-chromebook-vs-google-notebook-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.tawjih.com/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-chromebook-vs-google-notebook-768x543.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>A <strong>Google Chromebook</strong> is a laptop designed to run Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system developed by Google. Chromebooks are designed to be cloud-centric, meaning most of their software and data reside on the internet rather than on the device itself. Chrome OS is optimized for internet-based activities such as browsing the web, using web applications, and storing files on the cloud via Google Drive.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features of Google Chromebooks:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Operating System</strong>: Chrome OS, a fast, secure, and simple operating system.</li>



<li><strong>Cloud Integration</strong>: Heavily reliant on cloud-based services like Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Docs for productivity and storage.</li>



<li><strong>Affordability</strong>: Generally more affordable than traditional laptops, making them popular among students and budget-conscious buyers.</li>



<li><strong>Lightweight and Portable</strong>: Chromebooks are typically thinner, lighter, and more portable than standard laptops.</li>



<li><strong>Battery Life</strong>: Known for long battery life, with some models lasting up to 12-14 hours on a single charge.</li>



<li><strong>App Ecosystem</strong>: Primarily focused on web apps, though Android apps from the Google Play Store are supported on some Chromebooks.</li>
</ol>



<p>Chromebooks are ideal for users who perform tasks such as web browsing, email management, document editing, and media consumption. However, for users who need to run heavy software like video editing tools or advanced design programs, Chromebooks may not be the best choice due to their reliance on cloud computing and limited local processing power.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Google Notebook?</h4>



<p>A <strong>Google Notebook</strong> is an older concept and more commonly referred to as <strong>Google Keep</strong> or <strong>Google Docs/Google Slides</strong>, part of the broader suite of productivity tools provided by Google. These tools are web-based applications that allow users to create, edit, and store documents, presentations, and notes on the cloud.</p>



<p>While &#8220;Google Notebook&#8221; doesnâ€™t refer to a specific hardware product, many people may associate it with the broader set of tools that integrate seamlessly with Googleâ€™s ecosystem. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the popular Google Notebook services:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Google Keep</strong>: A note-taking app where users can jot down quick ideas, tasks, or reminders. It&#8217;s integrated with Googleâ€™s cloud, and notes can be shared across devices, synced, and organized with labels or colors.</li>



<li><strong>Google Docs/Google Slides/Google Sheets</strong>: These are cloud-based productivity tools, like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, respectively. They allow users to create documents, presentations, and spreadsheets that are automatically saved and updated in Google Drive.</li>



<li><strong>Google Jamboard</strong>: A digital whiteboard that allows users to collaborate and brainstorm together in real-time.</li>
</ol>



<p>Thus, when people refer to <strong>Google Notebooks</strong>, they often mean <strong>Google Keep</strong> or related note-taking and cloud-based applications that help store and organize personal and work-related notes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Key Differences Between Google Chromebook and Google Notebook</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Google Chromebook</th><th>Google Notebook (Google Keep, Docs, etc.)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definition</strong></td><td>A cloud-based laptop running Chrome OS</td><td>A suite of cloud-based applications (like Keep and Docs)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Hardware (Laptop)</td><td>Software (Note-taking and productivity tools)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Primary Function</strong></td><td>General computing, web browsing, cloud storage</td><td>Note-taking, document creation, organization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>Chrome OS</td><td>Web-based applications accessible through any OS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hardware</strong></td><td>Physical device (Laptop)</td><td>No hardware; software-based applications</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Usage</strong></td><td>Browsing, media, light productivity, education</td><td>Notes, documents, spreadsheets, presentations</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Example Devices</strong></td><td>Acer Chromebook, HP Chromebook, Lenovo Chromebook</td><td>Google Keep, Google Docs, Google Sheets</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Which Should You Choose?</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Choose a Google Chromebook</strong> if you&#8217;re looking for a lightweight laptop for daily use, web browsing, online work, and need portability with good battery life. It&#8217;s a great choice for students, teachers, and anyone looking for an affordable, efficient device primarily used for cloud-based tasks.</li>



<li><strong>Choose Google Notebook apps (like Google Keep, Docs, etc.)</strong> if you need a tool for organizing thoughts, taking notes, collaborating on documents, or managing projects. These tools can be accessed on any device with an internet connection and are perfect for people who need an efficient way to capture ideas and manage tasks.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>



<p>To sum up, <strong>Google Chromebooks</strong> and <strong>Google Notebooks</strong> serve distinct purposes. A Chromebook is a physical device with a dedicated operating system (Chrome OS), whereas Google Notebooks refers to a suite of cloud-based productivity tools designed to help users create and organize content. Depending on your needs, you may use both together for the best experienceâ€”working on a Chromebook while utilizing Googleâ€™s powerful suite of cloud-based apps to manage your work or notes.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the choice between a Google Chromebook and Google Notebook depends on whether you need a laptop for general tasks or a suite of apps to assist in organization and productivity.</p>

<p><strong>BMW Z3: The Iconic Roadster That Defined a Generation</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>BMW Z3</strong> is a classic roadster that became an icon of automotive design, blending German engineering with a sleek, stylish appearance. First introduced in 1995, the Z3 quickly garnered attention for its performance, luxurious features, and distinctive design. Whether you&#8217;re an automotive enthusiast or just a fan of high-performance vehicles, the BMW Z3 remains one of the most memorable cars in BMW&#8217;s history.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Birth of the BMW Z3</h1>



<p>The <strong>BMW Z3</strong> made its debut in the mid-1990s, initially as a concept car at the 1995 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The reception was overwhelming, and BMW decided to move forward with production, launching the roadster in 1996. The Z3 marked BMWâ€™s return to the roadster market after the BMW 507 of the 1950s, and it became an instant hit due to its balance of performance, design, and affordability.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="316" height="160" src="https://www.tawjih.com/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/bmw-z3-photo.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-125" srcset="https://www.tawjih.com/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/bmw-z3-photo.jpg 316w, https://www.tawjih.com/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/bmw-z3-photo-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px" /></figure>



<p>Produced in Spartanburg, South Carolina, the Z3 was available in several versions, including the <strong>Z3 1.8</strong>, <strong>Z3 2.8</strong>, and the more powerful <strong>Z3 M</strong>. The Z3 offered something for every driving enthusiast, whether it was the everyday driver or the high-performance sports car lover.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Design and Features</h3>



<p>The design of the <strong>BMW Z3</strong> is perhaps one of the most defining features of this roadster. With its long hood, low stance, and muscular rear haunches, the Z3 exudes classic roadster proportions. The car&#8217;s front end, with its signature round headlights and kidney grille, is unmistakably BMW. Its compact, two-seat design gives the Z3 a sense of intimacy and connection to the road, making it ideal for spirited drives and weekend getaways.</p>



<p>Inside, the Z3 maintained the high standards of BMWâ€™s interior design. The cabin was driver-focused, with high-quality materials and a simple, functional layout. The dashboard was clean and easy to read, while the seats were comfortable yet supportive. With options for leather upholstery and a premium sound system, the Z3 was a roadster that combined sportiness with luxury.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Performance: A Thrilling Drive</h3>



<p>The <strong>BMW Z3</strong> earned a reputation for delivering a thrilling driving experience. Thanks to its lightweight construction and rear-wheel-drive layout, the Z3 provided agile handling and precise steering. The Z3 was equipped with a range of engine options, including four-cylinder engines for the more entry-level models and six-cylinder engines for the higher trims.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Z3 1.8</strong>: With a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, this version was perfect for those who wanted a more affordable and fuel-efficient roadster.</li>



<li><strong>Z3 2.8</strong>: The 2.8-liter six-cylinder engine provided a significant boost in performance, offering a more powerful engine with enhanced acceleration and top-end speed.</li>



<li><strong>Z3 M</strong>: The ultimate performance model, the Z3 M was powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six engine, producing around 240 horsepower. This made the Z3 M one of the most potent roadsters of its time, capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in just over 5 seconds.</li>
</ul>



<p>With a smooth 5-speed manual or automatic transmission, the Z3 provided excellent driving dynamics, combining a firm suspension with responsive steering. Whether cruising on highways or taking sharp turns on winding roads, the Z3 remained poised and confident, making it a favorite among driving purists.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The BMW Z3 in Pop Culture</h3>



<p>The <strong>BMW Z3</strong> became more than just a car; it became a symbol of cool, especially after its prominent appearance in the 1995 James Bond film <em>GoldenEye</em>. Pierce Brosnanâ€™s 007 drove a BMW Z3 through the action-packed scenes of the movie, cementing the carâ€™s place in pop culture history. The carâ€™s stylish design and connection to Bondâ€™s character helped boost its popularity, attracting new fans to the BMW brand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Legacy and Impact</h3>



<p>While production of the <strong>BMW Z3</strong> ended in 2002, its legacy endures. The Z3 paved the way for the future of BMW roadsters, including its successor, the <strong>BMW Z4</strong>. The Z3 was instrumental in introducing a new generation of drivers to BMWâ€™s philosophy of sportiness, precision, and luxury.</p>



<p>The Z3&#8217;s combination of style, performance, and affordability helped establish it as one of the most beloved roadsters of its era. Today, it remains a sought-after classic among collectors and driving enthusiasts alike. Many enthusiasts still enjoy the thrill of owning a Z3, either as a weekend driver or as a project car to restore to its original glory.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">BMW Z3: A Collectorâ€™s Car</h3>



<p>As a car that blends timeless style with solid engineering, the <strong>BMW Z3</strong> has become a collectible classic. Well-maintained Z3s, particularly the M models, have seen an increase in value over the years. The car&#8217;s popularity in both the U.S. and Europe ensures that it will continue to be a favorite among collectors for years to come.</p>



<p>If youâ€™re looking for a used Z3 today, prices can vary depending on the model year, condition, and location. The more powerful <strong>Z3 M</strong> is typically the most expensive, but even non-M models offer incredible value for anyone looking for a fun, stylish roadster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: The Enduring Appeal of the BMW Z3</h3>



<p>The <strong>BMW Z3</strong> holds a special place in automotive history. Its blend of performance, luxury, and style made it a standout model during its production run and has ensured its place as a classic in todayâ€™s automotive world. Whether youâ€™re drawn to its design, the thrill of driving, or the memories of its Hollywood debut, the Z3 is a roadster that continues to captivate car enthusiasts around the globe.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re in the market for a fun and affordable classic sports car, the <strong>BMW Z3</strong> is certainly worth considering. With its engaging driving experience and iconic design, the Z3 will always be remembered as one of BMWâ€™s most successful and beloved roadsters.</p>

<p>With the 2024 elections looming on the horizon, political landscapes across various regions are abuzz with speculation, anticipation, and strategic maneuvering. In the state of Tamil Nadu, one figure that continues to draw attention is Seeman, the firebrand leader of the Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK). As the leader of a regional party known for its staunch Tamil nationalism and social justice agenda, Seeman&#8217;s influence and potential impact on the election results cannot be overlooked.</p>



<p><strong>The Rise of Seeman and the NTK</strong></p>



<p>Seeman, born as Sebastian Seeman, emerged on the political scene in Tamil Nadu in the early 2000s. His impassioned speeches, commitment to Tamil identity, and vocal opposition to perceived injustices against the Tamil community quickly earned him a dedicated following, particularly among the youth and marginalized sections of society.</p>



<p>In 2010, Seeman founded the Naam Tamilar Katchi (We Tamil Party), positioning it as a platform to champion the cause of Tamil nationalism, social equality, and the rights of the Tamil people. The party&#8217;s ideology revolves around the concept of &#8220;Tamil Eelam,&#8221; advocating for a separate, independent Tamil state in Sri Lanka, and asserting Tamil pride and identity in the face of perceived marginalization by the central government.</p>



<p><strong>Seeman&#8217;s Political Strategy and Electoral Prospects</strong></p>



<p>As the leader of a regional party with a niche ideological focus, Seeman faces both opportunities and challenges in the upcoming 2024 elections.</p>



<p><em>Opportunities:</em></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Tamil Nationalism Appeal:</strong> Seeman&#8217;s unwavering commitment to Tamil nationalism and social justice resonates strongly with a significant segment of the Tamil electorate, particularly in rural areas and among marginalized communities.</li>



<li><strong>Anti-Incumbency Sentiment:</strong> In politics, anti-incumbency sentiment often works in favor of opposition parties. Seeman and the NTK could capitalize on disillusionment with the ruling party or coalition, positioning themselves as a viable alternative.</li>



<li><strong>Youth Support:</strong> Seeman&#8217;s charisma and ability to connect with the youth have contributed to a growing base of support among young voters, who are increasingly disillusioned with mainstream political parties.</li>
</ol>



<p><em>Challenges:</em></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Limited Electoral Base:</strong> While Seeman enjoys a dedicated following, the NTK&#8217;s electoral base remains relatively small compared to major Dravidian parties like the DMK and AIADMK. Expanding beyond the party&#8217;s traditional support base will be crucial for electoral success.</li>



<li><strong>Alliance Dynamics:</strong> Tamil Nadu&#8217;s political landscape is characterized by alliances and coalitions, often necessitated by the state&#8217;s multi-cornered electoral contests. Navigating alliance dynamics and securing strategic partnerships will be essential for the NTK to maximize its electoral prospects.</li>



<li><strong>Organizational Strength:</strong> Building a robust organizational structure and ground-level presence is essential for mobilizing support and ensuring effective campaign outreach. Strengthening the party&#8217;s organizational machinery will be a key focus for Seeman and his team in the lead-up to the elections.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Implications for the 2024 Election Results</strong></p>



<p>As Tamil Nadu gears up for the 2024 elections, Seeman&#8217;s role and the electoral performance of the NTK are poised to have significant implications for the state&#8217;s political landscape.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Coalition Dynamics:</strong> Seeman&#8217;s willingness to form alliances or forge electoral pacts with other parties could shape the formation of pre-poll alliances and post-election coalition scenarios.</li>



<li><strong>Voice of Dissent:</strong> Regardless of electoral outcomes, Seeman and the NTK serve as a vocal voice of dissent, challenging mainstream narratives and advocating for the rights and aspirations of Tamil Nadu&#8217;s diverse populace.</li>



<li><strong>Policy Agenda:</strong> Seeman&#8217;s presence in the political arena ensures that issues such as Tamil nationalism, social justice, and regional autonomy remain central to the discourse, influencing policy agendas and governance priorities.</li>
</ol>



<p>In conclusion, Seeman&#8217;s emergence as a prominent political figure in Tamil Nadu reflects the complex interplay of identity, ideology, and electoral dynamics in the state. While the NTK faces challenges on multiple fronts, its ability to galvanize support and articulate a distinct political vision underscores the enduring relevance of regional parties in India&#8217;s diverse political landscape. As the countdown to the 2024 elections begins, all eyes will be on Seeman and the NTK, as they seek to make their mark on Tamil Nadu&#8217;s political trajectory.</p>

<p>The federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in its budget report for fiscal 2022-23, tabled in February, imposed a staggering 30 per cent tax on cryptocurrency investors.</p>



<p>Although the 30 percent tax was high, they were persuaded not to impose a ban. The 30 per cent tax will come into effect from April 1 and the additional tax will come into effect from July 1.  According to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Seetharaman, capital gains tax will be levied at 30 per cent on profits made on investments in cryptocurrency, NFT and all other digital assets, as well as 1 per cent TDS tax levied on investments exceeding a certain level from July 1.</p>



<p>Although this one per cent tax levy will generate additional revenue for the state, it will be used to collect important information on who is investing in which account for the crypto investment market. This 1 per cent TDS tax will come into effect from July 1. For example, suppose a trader trades 10 transactions a day for 10 lakh rupees each. Now if the TDS is 1 per cent then they have to pay a tax of around Rs 1 lakh per 10 transactions at the rate of Rs 10,000 per transaction.</p>



<p>But 1 per cent tax will not be levied if the business is traded within the existing account within the trading platform. Tax will be levied only when the new is brought into the trading account. It&#8217;s almost like sending money or charging another person&#8217;s IMPS.</p>



<p>The federal finance minister did not say whether the 1 per cent TCS tax would hurt big investors. And this tax will affect all major investors.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Biryani has not only become a favorite food of the Indian people but its trade is growing day by day at a rocket speed. Ramya is the one who correctly predicted this trend and went into business.</p>



<p>Do you know How Ramya Created a Briyani Business &amp; Earned Rs 8 Crore in Just 1.5 Years?  How much She Invested ? Let See in Detail.</p>



<p>Hotels are among the most affected business segments in India during the Corona Time,  sad news that millions of hotels across India have been closed due to lack of trade and revenue. Itâ€™s a one-page story.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Online Food Delivery</h2>



<p>during this lockdown period that online food delivery companies have gained more trades. Similarly, all the companies in India, especially those with Cloud Kitchen, have been gaining attraction during this lockdown period.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">RNR Biryani Started</h2>



<p>Ramya Ravi enters the industry in November 2020,  When all others facing the worst decline in the hotel business.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 Lakh Investment Business</h2>



<p>In November 2020 Ramya starts her business in Algiers under the name of RNR donne Biryani in a cloud kitchen set-double in a room of just 200 sq. Ft. With an investment of Rs 5 lakh as there is only a 50 per cent chance of success for her endeavor.</p>



<p>There are only 3 employees, only one cook and 2 assistants for this cloud kitchen. Ramya with his sister Swetha to manage the business. The two younger generation women has earned Rs 8 crore in just 1.5 years and Ramya and Swetha say that the RNR Biryani Cloud Kitchen business will touch Rs 10 crore by March 2022. How is this possible?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Donne Biryani </h2>



<p>donne biryani  is just like the ambur biryani for Tamil Nadu and donne biryani for Karnataka. donne biryani is very popular in Karnataka but its name is unlikely to be known to many as it is not popular in other states.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cloud Kitchen</h2>



<p>Let us first learn about Cloud Kitchen. Cloud Kitchen is a setup that runs exclusively for online trading, and this Cloud Kitchen food will be prepared and shipped online. This cloud kitchen does not have the hotel seating arrangement. It is a great framework for those who are just starting their business on a small budget, targeting online customers only. You can even set up this cloud kitchen setup in your home.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Online Food Order </h2>



<p>The number of online food orders began to increase rapidly during the Corona era as people were paralyzed at home. Realizing this, Ramya transformed the entire business to attract online customers. SHE focused more on the package in order to attract online Food customers. The RNR donne biryani has received special attention among the customers as it packs the biryani in a blue tin box and comes with the best quality overall package of sweet, rye and salad.</p>



<p>This is why RNR donne Biryani has become the biggest trend among Algiers online customers in a short span of time. The RNR donne biryani brand sells chicken biryani for Rs 189 to Rs 289 and mutton biryani for Rs 320.</p>



<p>by Introducing new dishes such as Drumstick Chili, Mutton Soup, Chicken Ghee Roast, Juicy Poultry to attract more customers It was a hit among customers from all walks of life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Swiggy exclusive delivery partner </h2>



<p></p>



<p>Ramya signed an exclusive delivery partner agreement with Swiggy for one year as the RNR donne biryani business began to grow rapidly. This means that the RNR donne biryani cannot be sold on any other Online Website Site, instead the Swiggy will do the Promotion &amp; be the biggest advertiser for the RNR donne biryani.</p>



<p>A one-year contract can seem complicated at an early stage. But this is where Ramya uses her Harvard degree to her advantage. Failure to do this will result in the cost of advertising to trade on all delivery sites.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Swiggy and Zomato</h2>



<p>Swiggy is currently doing this promotional work. Similarly RNR donne biryani owner Ramya&#8217;s idea is that 70 per cent of the customers at Swiggy and Zomato are the same people so they can expand the business massively after one year anyway.  RNR donne biryani with Swiggy has accumulated around 10000 orders in the first month of its one year contract alone. Not only this, with the help of Swiggy RNR donne biryani it has been named the finest brand of 2020.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Facebook Advertisement</h2>



<p>Ramya has been spending Rs 1.5 lakh on advertising for the first 3 months through Facebook and other social networking sites such as RNR donne Biryani. In addition, the social media posts of Kannada actresses Manvita and Nishvika have gained a lot of support.</p>



<p>Ramya, who started the business with a revenue target of Rs 10 crore with just 3 people, has today created a huge business empire with a revenue of Rs 10 crore, a retail shop and 60 employees.</p>
